Instructional App to display JSON as a ListView

This Android App is intended for instructional purposes only. To use download the source code, open Eclipse, and start a New Android from Source Code. Navigate to the source code folder and finish creating the project. From there set up your RUN configuration to either launch on your attached Device or Android Emulator. 

If you have any suggestions for improvement I'd love to hear them! Thanks and enjoy!
